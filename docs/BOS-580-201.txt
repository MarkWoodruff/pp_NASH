For Etienne:
	1) values that represent stopping criteria, as defined in the protocol
	2) listing of G3 or G4 safety labs
	3) listing of ECGs
	3) AEs of Special Interest
	4) listing of G3 or G4 vital signs
	5) other things listed in Medical Monitor reports that he did not specifically call out
		a) listing of physical exam
		b) graph of QTcF (might as well do all)
		c) listing of demographics
	6) Shelley will provide table of site number and time zone, use that and TIME OF SYRINGE LOADED (will be added to DB) to determine timing difference between dose administration adn time of syringe loaded.  Flag those later than 24 hours.
External Hepatologist
	1) Needs profile access
	2) interim analysis will be sometime next year
	3) first SRT will be sometime early December, all outputs ready 5 business days in advance.
	4) for Tanya's ECG/Vitals emails, just do frequencies of those meeting things in her email.  Labs by grade.
	5) ia will be me, tanja, alicia
	6) need to have RTF
	7) listings can be Excel

** EXTERNAL DATA **
*******************
	1) MRI data from BioTel Research - comes monthly, first should have been end of September.
	2) lab data from LabConnect - look in DMP, it specifies each lab test they will do.  They are taking external data and putting that in LB.
	3) Nordic Biosciences (Pro-C3) - Biomarker.  DTA not done yet.
	4) PPD (Biomarkers).  DTA not done yet.
	5) LGC - PK and ADA.  DTA not done yet.

** TO-DO **
***********
-finish base build (AEs)
-finish Tanya ranges
-SK: flag visit/dates not matching
-macro to sort with unscheduled visits, update all domains
-add graphs for labs, vitals, ecg including color flagging




**************
** SCHEDULE **
**************
-first interim analysis is 6 weeks after 90% of patients have completed week 6 assessment.
-baseline profiles on Sharepoint by 10/1
-full profiles set up by 10/8
-baseline tables set up by end of October

Study Setup
	Part A: 5 cohorts (A1 - A4, A5 randomized separately) - approximately 75 subjects.
		A1: 300 mg Q4W or PBO
		A2: 150 mg Q2W or PBO
		A3: 75 mg Q2W or PBO
		A4: 75 mg Q4W or PBO
		A5: 30 mg Q4W or PBO
	Part B: MAYBE, after Week 6 interim analysis for A1-A4 are reviewed by FDA.
		Bx: up to ~30 subjects

	Screening 1 (Day -35 to Day -10)
	Screening 2 (Day -28 to Day -4) - Imaging Evaluation
	Study Treatment Period
	Post-Treatment Follow-up, including a visit 4 weeks after last dose.
	Total Duration for each subject is approximately 21 weeks

*********
** SRT **
*********
-SRT will formally look at blinded tables/listings on a quarterly basis.  
-But teams also looking more often, to maintain safety overview.  
-Pretty consistent with 721 or 738.  
-Section 10.0 of Charter shows what tables and listings will be created.  
-ECGs Tanya seems to be thinking on what she wants to see.  
-SRT Charter is a starting point, not a firm concrete guidance.

**********************
** INTERIM ANALYSIS **
**********************
-FDA asked for this.  Cato may do interim, currently 5w, trying to get it to 4w.  
-May rely on some of my tables (baseline + AE), Cato could do others.  Craig was OK with that.  Regulatory weighing in too.  
-Not a fileable interim analysis, will not be submitted.  Mostly for internal.
-Baseline Disease Hx table: include time from diag to study entry.  did they have gall bladder disease.  VCTE for those who reach week 12, if possible, otehrwise Cato will do.  
-Nuventra will do PK stuff and Biomarker stuff.
-HFF response - from MRI, Cato will do
-have time on study and time on treatment in disposition.
-group all placebo together.  have totals in baseline tables.  possible button for blinded/unblinded.
-maybe have 580 unblinded card, OR have SRT tab, interim tab.
-30th and first week of October for randomization.
-first meeting mid-October
-meet once a quarter after that
-FDA asked about Cortisol
-shift tables for triglycerides and cholesterol
