-first SRT is 1/18.
-TLs due EOD 1/10.
-Datacut 1/6. 
-first interim analysis is 6 weeks after 90% of patients have completed week 6 assessment.

Study Setup
	Part A: 5 cohorts (A1 - A4, A5 randomized separately) - approximately 75 subjects.
		A1: 300 mg Q4W or PBO
		A2: 150 mg Q2W or PBO
		A3: 75 mg Q2W or PBO
		A4: 75 mg Q4W or PBO
		A5: 30 mg Q4W or PBO
	Part B: MAYBE, after Week 6 interim analysis for A1-A4 are reviewed by FDA.
		Bx: up to ~30 subjects

	Screening 1 (Day -35 to Day -10)
	Screening 2 (Day -28 to Day -4) - Imaging Evaluation
	Study Treatment Period
	Post-Treatment Follow-up, including a visit 4 weeks after last dose.
	Total Duration for each subject is approximately 21 weeks

** SRT in January **

-Placebo won't be there - 300 mg Q4W (no mention of PBO or BOS)
-SRT will formally look at blinded tables/listings on a quarterly basis.  
-But teams also looking more often, to maintain safety overview.  
-Pretty consistent with 721 or 738.  
-Section 10.0 of Charter shows what tables and listings will be created.  
-ECGs Tanya seems to be thinking on what she wants to see.  
-SRT Charter is a starting point, not a firm concrete guidance.

** Difficulties **
1) programming with thin data - have to constantly backtrack to revisit things as data is populated
2) SAP text and shells undergoing multiple revisions after I've already started work
3) Coding not included.  Can not set up AE tables at beginning.

**********************
** INTERIM ANALYSIS - data-cut March at earliest.  IA sometime 1Q 2022 (maybe even later).  Readout in May or June. **
**********************
-FDA asked for this.  Cato may do interim, currently 5w, trying to get it to 4w.  
-some of my tables, Cato could do others.  Craig was OK with that.  Regulatory weighing in too.  
-Not a fileable interim analysis, will not be submitted.  Mostly for internal.
-Baseline Disease Hx table: include time from diag to study entry.  did they have gall bladder disease.  VCTE for those who reach week 12, if possible, otehrwise Cato will do.  
-Nuventra will do PK stuff and Biomarker stuff.
-HFF response - from MRI, Cato will do
-have time on study and time on treatment in disposition.
-group all placebo together.  have totals in baseline tables.
-have SRT tab, interim tab.
-first safety meeting mid-October, then once a quarter
-FDA asked about Cortisol
-shift tables for triglycerides and cholesterol
on part b tables, have A Overall, B Overall, Overall Overall

** EXTERNAL DATA **
*******************
	1) MRI data from BioTel Research - comes monthly, first should have been end of September.
	2) lab data from LabConnect - look in DMP, it specifies each lab test they will do.  They are taking external data and putting that in LB.
	3) Nordic Biosciences (Pro-C3) - Biomarker.  DTA not done yet.
	4) PPD (Biomarkers).  DTA not done yet.
	5) LGC - PK and ADA.  DTA not done yet.
