** DONE - INTERIM ANALYSIS **;
*****************************;
DONE QUESTIONS FOR ALICIA
1) DONE For ALT, AST, AlkPhos, was incorrectly grading baseline as grade 0 rather than grade 1 for around 20 patients. TOLD AC.
2) DONE For labshifts, when multiple visits per lab per patient, use worst or last?  LAST.
3) DONE Listings all unblinded or leave as blinded like SRT? Unblinded.
4) DONE For IA link at top of profiles, just Alicia/Tanja/me? Yes
5) DONE Do I need to add 'time from diagnosis to study entry' to demographics table for IA?  Had that in old notes.  ALICIA SAID NO.
6) DONE - Disp. shell defines time on study as EOS - randdt, but SAP defines it as EOS - infcondt.  Which?  Followed shell in SRT.  INF.
7) DONE - Compliance mean for Cohort 5 is below 80%, due to site entering dose incorrectly for one patient.  Did 0.03 instead of 0.3.

FINISHING INTERIM ANALYSIS
	-DONE rerun everything on same datacut, but with treatment fixed.
	-DONE build all versions
	-DONE fix Cohort 5 headers
	-DONE make sure percentages are in correct format
	-DONE set up restricted area 
	-DONE make IA link in regular areas go to new IA site.
	-DONE fix SRT->SRT link that has output/output/
	-DONE verify results against normal SRT.
	-DONE fix compliance for cohort 5 (30mg/150mg)
	-DONE fix ADSL for Cohort 5 TRTU
	-DONE make listings unblinded
	-DONE remove Etienne
	-DONE rerun/upload SRT for labs consistency
	-DONE check ECG biggest and smallest values versus table
	-DONE check Albumin is graded correctly as all are grade 0.
	-DONE check Bilirubin grading (especially baseline), as no G1 baseline.
	-DONE check Creatinine grading (especially baseline), as no G1 baseline.
	-DONE check Lymphocytes grading, as there are tons of grade 0.
	-DONE re-check Nancy's ADS programs
	-DONE re-check all my table output
	-DONE switch IA link in SRT/Profiles live when ready.  Code is in SRT prog.
	-DONE upload all and test

** NEXT SRT SCHEDULE **
***********************
DONE TLF to Tanja: EOD 4/7
DONE TLF to SRT:   EOD 4/12
DONE Meeting:      Wed 4/20

**********************
** NEXT IA SCHEDULE **
**********************
data-cut: 5/12 (was 4/28)
TLF first draft:
	preferred: 5/26 (was 5/12)
	absolute: ?? (was 5/24)
final TLF: ?? (was 6/7)

Study Setup
	Part A: 5 cohorts (A1 - A4, A5 randomized separately) - approximately 75 subjects.
		A1: 300 mg Q4W or PBO
		A2: 150 mg Q2W or PBO
		A3: 75 mg Q2W or PBO
		A4: 75 mg Q4W or PBO
		A5: 30 mg Q4W or PBO
	Part B: MAYBE, after Week 6 interim analysis for A1-A4 are reviewed by FDA.
		Bx: up to ~30 subjects

*************************
** SRT in January 2022 **
*************************
-first SRT is 1/18 (TLs due 1/10, datacut 1/6)
-Placebo won't be there - 300 mg Q4W (no mention of PBO or BOS)
-SRT will formally look at blinded tables/listings on a quarterly basis.  
-But teams also looking more often, to maintain safety overview.  
-Pretty consistent with 721 or 738.  
-Section 10.0 of Charter shows what tables and listings will be created.  
-ECGs Tanya seems to be thinking on what she wants to see.  
-SRT Charter is a starting point, not a firm concrete guidance.


**********************
** INTERIM ANALYSIS **
**********************
-FDA asked for this.  Cato may do interim, currently 5w, trying to get it to 4w.  
-some of my tables, Cato could do others.  Craig was OK with that.  Regulatory weighing in too.  
-Not a fileable interim analysis, will not be submitted.  Mostly for internal.
-Baseline Disease Hx table: include time from diag to study entry.  did they have gall bladder disease.  VCTE for those who reach week 12, if possible, otehrwise Cato will do.  
-Nuventra will do PK stuff and Biomarker stuff.
-HFF response - from MRI, Cato will do
-have time on study and time on treatment in disposition.
-group all placebo together.  have totals in baseline tables.
-have SRT tab, interim tab.
-first safety meeting mid-October, then once a quarter
-FDA asked about Cortisol
-shift tables for triglycerides and cholesterol
on part b tables, have A Overall, B Overall, Overall Overall

** EXTERNAL DATA **
*******************
	1) MRI data from BioTel Research - comes monthly, first should have been end of September.
	2) lab data from LabConnect - look in DMP, it specifies each lab test they will do.  They are taking external data and putting that in LBX.
	3) Nordic Biosciences (Pro-C3) - Biomarker.  DTA not done yet.
	4) PPD (Biomarkers).  DTA not done yet.
	5) LGC - PK and ADA.  DTA not done yet.
